<h1>Brief description of site purpose and target audience</h1>
I worked on developing an online mobile accessory shop. Target audience will be customers who want to purchase cell phone accessories
from the store. The development was an attempt to create an online catalog for the store customer.  
This will help make it easy for customers to find products and help with browsing products before coming to store.
