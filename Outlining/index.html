<h1>Outlining Course Learning </h1>
<p>I believe outlining the takeaways after a course completion is a necessary step in our quest to understand individual progress. It forces 
student to walk down the memory lane and reflect on how it all started. Fortunately, I am filled with positive thoughts about 
the overall progress I made during Mobile Web Development course. I have learned about many different aspects 
from Site Prototyping to developing a project that can be shared with an end-user. </p>
<p>I think covering broad set of tools and technologies such as GitHub, Codepen.io, Figma, Gravit.io and Cloud based IDE at the initial stage
during the semester helped greatly with what the expectations are and to get a good understanding of upcoming weeks. The initial deployment 
of setting up cloud workspace and working with GitHub helped put together progress on the web. I got exposure to different technologies and
through feedback and building on these concepts during the class made it much easier to breakdown work in different sections. I think I have 
acquired a comprehensive development understanding that addresses prototype requirement, to final development.</p>
<p>The most interesting discovery period throughout the semester was to come up with a project idea. When I finalized that I will be working on
Mobile accessory shop, it took off a lot of pressure on how to find something thatâ€™s meaningful. I truly enjoyed exploring different areas
of website development learning more about different development platform including Grid based design, web framework, Bootstrapping and other
development tools. To me, the most challenging exercise was to be able to narrow down options and focus areas that will give me good learning
experience along with meeting project requirement. </p>
<p>The other major aspect of the class was creating resume covering different aspect of development such as mobile view, tablet view and other related
areas. Learning about different tools such as GitHub, and AWS was a great experience. I got exposure to different development approaches including
Bootstrapping.</p>
<p>In the final weeks, I learned a lot about using different tools such as Google Analytics, and web hosting. The feedback during the class made me
feel very comfortable discussing my issues or presenting ideas. During different aspects of project development, I experienced significant 
improvements in my initial works and final submissions. With what I have learned so far, I think a good developer is someone who can take 
ideas and build a prototype to support the requirement, and develop something that addresses the need, and help end-users/clients connect what
may come next. I am sure I have a long way to learn the art of good development but I felt good about my overall progress.</p>
<p>In conclusion, I must admit Mobile Web Development is one of the most difficult courses I took throughout my undergraduate degree, and also one 
of the most rewarding. I am excited about the progress I made and excited about the journey this learning takes me.</p>
